### 1. What is Heart Valve Disease?
Heart valve disease occurs when one or more of the heart’s valves do not work properly. Valves may fail to open fully (stenosis) or close completely (regurgitation), affecting blood flow and increasing the heart’s workload.

### 2. Types of Valvular Problems
- **Stenosis**: Valve doesn’t open fully, restricting flow
- **Regurgitation**: Valve leaks, allowing backflow of blood
- **Prolapse**: Valve flaps bulge backward (common in mitral valve)

### 3. Affected Valves
- **Aortic valve**: Controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the body
- **Mitral valve**: Between left atrium and left ventricle
- **Tricuspid valve**: Between right atrium and right ventricle
- **Pulmonary valve**: From right ventricle to lungs

### 4. Symptoms
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Lightheadedness or fainting
- Irregular heartbeat or palpitations
- Swelling in ankles, feet, or abdomen

### 5. Causes and Risk Factors
- Aging (degeneration of valves)
- Rheumatic fever (post-streptococcal infection)
- Congenital defects
- Endocarditis (infection of the heart lining)
- Radiation therapy to the chest
- Bicuspid aortic valve (genetic)
- High blood pressure and cholesterol

### 6. Differences Between Valve Diseases

**Aortic Stenosis:**
- Narrowed aortic valve limits blood to the body
- Common in elderly
- Causes chest pain, fainting, and shortness of breath

**Aortic Regurgitation:**
- Aortic valve leaks; blood flows back into left ventricle
- Causes fatigue, palpitations, and swelling

**Mitral Stenosis:**
- Narrowed mitral valve; usually due to rheumatic fever
- Symptoms include breathlessness and palpitations

**Mitral Regurgitation:**
- Leaky mitral valve; blood flows backward into atrium
- Causes fatigue, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles

**Tricuspid or Pulmonary Valve Issues:**
- Less common
- Often secondary to other heart or lung problems

### 7. Diagnosis
- Physical exam (listening for murmurs)
- Echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)
- Transesophageal echocardiography (for detailed view)
- ECG, chest X-ray, or cardiac MRI

### 8. Lifestyle and Prevention
- Eat a heart-healthy diet
- Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol
- Manage high blood pressure and cholesterol
- Treat strep infections promptly to prevent rheumatic fever
- Maintain good dental hygiene to reduce infection risk

### 9. Activity and Monitoring
- Regular follow-ups with echocardiograms
- Monitor for changes in symptoms like fatigue or breathlessness
- Discuss safe activity levels with your doctor
- Avoid extreme exertion if moderate/severe valve disease is present

### 10. Emotional Support
- Chronic heart valve disease may cause stress or worry
- Seek support from family, counselors, or peer groups
- Learn more about your condition to reduce uncertainty
