# Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO)

## Overview
Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) is a complete blockage of a coronary artery that has been present for more than 3 months. The blocked artery usually has collateral vessels providing some blood flow to the heart tissue, but this is often not sufficient.

## Causes
- Long-standing coronary artery disease
- Atherosclerotic plaque rupture with thrombosis
- Progressive plaque buildup

## Risk Factors
- Smoking
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Family history of CAD

## Signs & Symptoms
- Chest pain (angina) on exertion
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue
- Reduced exercise tolerance
- May be asymptomatic in some cases due to collateral circulation

## Diagnosis
- ECG abnormalities suggestive of ischemia
- Stress testing (exercise or pharmacologic)
- Coronary angiography (definitive test)
- Cardiac CT or MRI in select cases

## Management & Treatment
### Medical Management
- **Antiplatelet agents** (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel)
- **Statins** to reduce cholesterol
- **Beta-blockers** or calcium channel blockers
- **Nitrates** for symptom relief

### Revascularization Options
- **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)** with specialized techniques
- **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)** in complex cases

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Smoking cessation
- Regular exercise
- Weight loss
- Blood pressure and blood sugar control

## Diet Recommendations
- Low saturated fat and cholesterol
- High fiber diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables
- Reduce sodium intake

## Prognosis
Improved prognosis with timely intervention and medical therapy. Successful revascularization improves symptoms and quality of life.

## Monitoring & Follow-Up
- Periodic stress testing and imaging
- Monitor lipid profile, blood pressure, and glucose
- Cardiologist review every 6–12 months
