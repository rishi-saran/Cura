# Variant Angina (Prinzmetal’s Angina)

## Overview
Variant Angina, also known as Prinzmetal’s Angina, is a rare form of angina (chest pain) that usually occurs at rest, due to a spasm in a coronary artery. These spasms temporarily narrow the artery and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle.

## Causes
- Coronary artery spasm (primary cause)
- Tobacco use
- Cold exposure
- Stress or stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines)
- Underlying endothelial dysfunction

## Risk Factors
- Smoking
- High cholesterol
- Hypertension
- History of other vasospastic disorders
- Female gender (slightly more common)

## Signs & Symptoms
- Sudden chest pain at rest, often during nighttime or early morning
- Pain may radiate to arm, neck, or jaw
- Palpitations
- Nausea or sweating
- Often not triggered by physical exertion

## Diagnosis
- ECG showing transient ST-segment elevation during pain episodes
- Holter monitoring for detecting episodes
- Coronary angiography (to rule out obstructive CAD)
- Ergonovine or acetylcholine challenge test (provocation test during angiography)

## Management & Treatment
### Medications
- **Calcium channel blockers** (e.g., amlodipine, diltiazem)
- **Nitrates** (short-acting and long-acting)
- Avoid beta-blockers unless clearly needed

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Quit smoking
- Avoid cold exposure and emotional stress
- Avoid stimulants (e.g., caffeine, cocaine)
- Stress management techniques

### Emergency Management
- Sublingual nitroglycerin during pain episodes
- Immediate medical attention if prolonged pain

## Diet Recommendations
- Low-fat, low-cholesterol diet
- High in fruits, vegetables, whole grains
- Limit alcohol and caffeine

## Prognosis
Generally favorable with appropriate medical therapy and lifestyle changes. Persistent or untreated cases can lead to arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

## Monitoring & Follow-Up
- Regular ECG or Holter monitoring
- Assess control of symptoms and drug efficacy
- Annual cardiovascular evaluation
