### 1. What are Arrhythmias?
Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that occur when the electrical signals controlling the heartbeat are disrupted. This can cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregularly. Some arrhythmias are harmless, while others can be life-threatening.

### 2. Causes of Arrhythmias
- Coronary artery disease or prior heart attacks
- Structural changes in the heart (e.g., cardiomyopathy)
- Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, magnesium)
- Stress, caffeine, alcohol, or stimulant drugs
- Congenital heart abnormalities
- Thyroid disorders (especially hyperthyroidism)

### 3. Risk Factors
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Family history of arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death
- High blood pressure
- Obesity or diabetes
- Sleep apnea
- Smoking and alcohol use
- Certain medications or recreational drugs

### 4. Symptoms
- Palpitations (fluttering or pounding heart)
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fainting (syncope)
- Shortness of breath
- Chest discomfort
- Fatigue
- In some cases, no symptoms (asymptomatic arrhythmias)

### 5. Complications
- Stroke (especially with atrial fibrillation)
- Sudden cardiac arrest
- Heart failure
- Blood clots

### 6. Types of Arrhythmias
- **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)** – Irregular, often rapid heartbeat from the upper chambers
- **Atrial Flutter** – Rapid but more organized rhythm than AFib
- **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)** – Fast heartbeat starting above the ventricles
- **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** – Fast, potentially dangerous rhythm from the lower chambers
- **Ventricular Fibrillation (VFib)** – Disorganized, life-threatening rhythm causing cardiac arrest
- **Bradycardia** – Abnormally slow heartbeat
- **Heart Block** – Delay or complete block of electrical signals between upper and lower chambers

### 7. Diagnosis
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Holter monitor (24–48 hour ECG recording)
- Event recorder or implantable loop recorder
- Stress testing
- Electrophysiology study (EPS)

### 8. Lifestyle and Prevention
- Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and stimulant medications
- Manage stress and anxiety
- Treat underlying conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, thyroid disease)
- Exercise regularly within safe limits
- Maintain a heart-healthy diet

### 9. Activity Limitations
- Avoid high-intensity activities if prone to dangerous arrhythmias
- Monitor for dizziness or irregular pulse during activity
- Seek medical clearance before starting a new exercise routine
- Use devices (e.g., smartwatches or ECG patches) to track rhythm changes

### 10. Emotional and Mental Health
Living with arrhythmias can cause anxiety and fear. Patients are encouraged to:
- Learn about their condition to reduce fear
- Seek peer support groups or counseling
- Practice mindfulness, breathing techniques, or light yoga

### 11. Differences Between Types of Arrhythmias

**Atrial Fibrillation (AFib):**
- Most common arrhythmia
- Irregular and often fast
- Increases stroke risk due to blood pooling in atria

**Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):**
- Regular but very fast rhythm from ventricles
- May be sustained (dangerous) or nonsustained
- Can cause lightheadedness or loss of consciousness

**Ventricular Fibrillation (VFib):**
- Chaotic electrical activity in ventricles
- Causes sudden cardiac arrest
- Requires immediate defibrillation

**Bradycardia:**
- Slow heart rate (<60 bpm)
- May cause fatigue, dizziness, or fainting
- Often related to aging or conduction system disease

**Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT):**
- Sudden onset and stop
- Can cause palpitations, anxiety, or chest tightness
